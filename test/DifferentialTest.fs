/// Does the .NET renderer agree with lit?
///
/// The only honest way to ask is in a browser. `Lit.Server` produces a string and lit
/// produces a DOM, so the comparison parses the server's string into a DOM too and
/// compares what the browser makes of each. That normalises everything neither side
/// should be judged on: attribute quoting, the serialisation of a bare boolean
/// attribute, the order the parser hands things back.
///
/// lit's own marker comments are removed first. They are how lit finds its bindings
/// again on the next render, they are absent by design from server output, and leaving
/// them in would mean measuring them rather than the markup.
///
/// The expectations come from test/server-rendered.json, written by the .NET test
/// project from the same SharedViews.fs this file compiles. So `dotnet test` has to run
/// before `npm test`; if the file is missing, this fails rather than passes quietly.
