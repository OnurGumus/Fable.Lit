/// Custom elements that take part in forms.
///
/// A custom element is invisible to the form it sits in unless the class says
/// `static formAssociated = true`. With it, the element is handed an ElementInternals,
/// through which it can find its form, contribute a value to submission, and hear about
/// resets. `config.formAssociated <- true` is that line.
///
/// The test is the thing people actually build first: a submit button that is not a
/// <button>, which needs the form before it can ask it to submit.
