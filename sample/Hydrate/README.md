# Hydration sample

The same F# view rendered by .NET on the server and adopted by lit in the browser.

```bash
# from the repository root
dotnet fable sample/Hydrate/Client -o sample/Hydrate/Client/build
npx vite build --config sample/Hydrate/vite.config.mjs
dotnet run --project sample/Hydrate/Server
```

Then open <http://localhost:5199>.

## What to look at

`Shared/Views.fs` is compiled twice: by Fable against the lit bindings, and by the .NET
compiler against `Lit.Server`. It may use only what both provide, and it does not know
which of the two it is running as.

`Server/Program.fs` renders it with `toHydratableNode` — the same HTML as `toNode` plus
the comment markers lit uses to find its bindings again — and drops it into a page
template as a `Node`.

`Client/App.fs` calls `Hydrate.adopt`, which adopts that markup if it can and renders
over it if it cannot, saying so in the console either way.

## Proving it actually hydrated

Adoption is invisible: markup that was re-rendered looks exactly like markup that was
kept. Two ways to tell.

- Turn JavaScript off and reload. The table is still there, because .NET rendered it.
- With JavaScript on, hold a node and check it survives an update:

  ```js
  const row = document.querySelector('#app tbody tr')
  document.querySelector('#app button').click()
  document.querySelector('#app tbody tr') === row   // true: lit patched, it did not rebuild
  ```

  A console warning starting `lit could not adopt` means it fell back to a full render.

## Two things that will catch you out

**Hydrate the element the markers were written into.** The root marker wraps whatever
the template renders, so here that is `<div id="app">`, not the card inside it.
Hydrating the card puts lit inside its own root marker, where it never finds it.

**The client must pass the same template and the same data.** A different template is a
digest mismatch, which throws and is caught by `Hydrate.adopt`. Different data hydrates
cleanly and then shows values the server never rendered, which nothing catches.
